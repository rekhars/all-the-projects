tracfone service plus samsung has so many neat features to their phones like samsung themes also the price is a definite selling point definitely pleased with the purchase ', 'this is pretty much a budget device that being said it is a delightful product for what it is this is the international version so it has exynos octacore chipset it has gb internal storage fast charge and a mah battery this model also came with a free gb sd card to expand your internal storage the amoled panel is amazing full hd performance is pretty fast for a budget device build quality is excellent all plastic has mm headphone jack and earbuds really impressed keep your expectations realistic and this is a fantastic budget device ', 'i really like this phone the graphics is gorgeous took it to metro pcs and had them switch my lg stylo to this phone work perfectly the wifi works i can download my apps and it super fast when charging ', 'this is the nd phone i ve purchased in the same number of weeks i bought one for my wife and i loved the feel and looks of it the camera is great not exactly sure what a dual front camera does but the pictures are very clear it took a little work to adjust to the interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service number and they ll activate it for you and by calling you ll also save the activation fee we also kept the same sim card', 'the phone arrived on time a new phone to appreciate everything very well

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps

minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on

whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led

terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps

that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of

that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up

interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

bought one for my wife and i loved the feel and looks of it the camera is great not exactly sure what a dual front camera does but the pictures are very clear it took a little work to adjust to the interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this

after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

      "['i ve only had the a for a week but i absolutely love it great samsung phone for of course it does all the things you need a phone to do make calls text web surf but the display is great and the bezels are so thin i also like that since the phone is unlocked that i was easily able to switch out my sim card from my old phone and put it in this one and it worked immediately btw i have

bought one for my wife and i loved the feel and looks of it the camera is great not exactly sure what a dual front camera does but the pictures are very clear it took a little work to adjust to the

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few amazing features that even now i love however many of the negative reviews touch on the service quality this phone has even with or bars of lte and on wifi calling this phone struggles to connect with

insurance since the end of last month the phone has been glitching alarm sound doesn t come on when alarm goes off but all sound is on i have to reset the phone every couple days to reset it if i m listening to youtube with head phones and disconnect bluetooth the sound only comes out of the speaker at the ear of the phone so quiet you can t even hear it so i have to reset the phone again to get sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up

little low at gb but nothing that will cause issues the camera is sub par but quite usable in everyday moments performance is on par with a phones no glitches or any issues overall a really good phone for the price ', 'was afraid at first but getting use to it the only thing is i cant put a second sim card in the entry thing wont pop back out', 'i am very glad i got this phone for the price and me not being a person that needs all the bells whistles and steven spielberg cameras i am very satisfied i got a deal with a free sd card too ', 'this phone is soooo awesome i love it and i would definitely recommend purchasing it the red i got is so beautiful i brought it to t mobile to get the nano sim card and the clerk was like wow that s a sweet color i don t think t mobile carries the

types of technical issues people were telling me that my calls were going straight to voicemail i unplug the charger from the device and it would disconnect the phone from my conversation i press on

there is the only thing that is very awful about this phone is getting signals for example i used to have motoe and i have had signals everywhere but after using this phone i can t talk in my home

performance and speed ', 'works very well ', 'esta bien por el precio que pagas por esta madre', 'this phone is international so it is a third party phone not from the us it s an excellent phone for the price but deff spend a few extra bucks and try and find a better place to get it i go through straight talk which is said it d work on doesn t it only works for at t and t mobile straight talk not verizon straight talk would work excellent if you went through those tho i m sure im getting one right through straight talk so will be returning update i returned it and they were great with the refund anyways ', 'i have been using this phone for a little over a month and it offers everything a person could want in a cell phone great size for viewing e mails and outstanding camera and a solid value for its price point oh yes it does very well for calls and texts ', 'got the phone for my husband we have metropcs his old sim card didnt work so had to go to the authorize dealer and they had to put in a new sim card and they charged for the new sim card and activation fee so cost us about but worth it to get the phone to work it takes very clear pictures i love the look he really likes it

has mm headphone jack and earbuds really impressed keep your expectations realistic and this is a fantastic budget device ', 'i really like this phone the graphics is gorgeous took it to metro pcs and had them switch my lg stylo to this phone work perfectly the wifi works i can download my apps and it super fast when charging ', 'this is the nd phone i ve purchased in the same number of weeks i bought one for my wife and i loved the feel and looks of it the camera is great not exactly sure what a dual front camera does but the pictures are very clear it took a little work to adjust to the interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service number and they ll activate it for you and by calling you ll also save the activation fee we also kept the same sim card', 'the phone arrived on time a new phone to appreciate everything very well

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

over the iphone x or note ', 'great deal on a brand new never opened galaxy a although it is the international version the charger still fits u s outlets and no adapter is needed super functional and

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

refund anyways ', 'i have been using this phone for a little over a month and it offers everything a person could want in a cell phone great size for viewing e mails and outstanding camera and a solid value for its price point oh yes it does very well for calls and texts ', 'got the phone for my husband we have metropcs his old sim card didnt work so had to go to the authorize dealer and they had to put in a new sim card and they charged for the new sim card and activation fee so cost us about but worth it to get the phone to work it takes very clear pictures i love the look he really likes it

much money on a phone ', 'i had this phone for over a month now and i wanted to let people know about this phone it has great features for a little price the best things about this phone is the battery life it last for the entire day and if you need a charge it s quick charging the screen isn t the greatest but it s decent the camera isn t the best but it s adequate the ring is loud okay to sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery and charging works great for tmobile not wireless charging nor water resistant expandable memory and slightly on the heavy side ', 'i needed a new phone after my galaxy j prime quit on me after getting rained on this phone was in store but buying it cheaper on amazon i ve had no problems whatsoever i transferred my sim myself and sd card optional and i m up and running no phone call or tech

interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just

upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps

defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few amazing features that even now i love however many of the negative reviews touch on the service quality this phone has even with or bars of lte and on wifi calling this phone struggles to connect with

amazon stole my original one on the positive the camera is amazing and the screen is very nice don t order this phone ', 'new update i ve had this new phone for two months i did not purchase the insurance since the end of last month the phone has been glitching alarm sound doesn t come on when alarm goes off but all sound is on i have to reset the phone every couple days to reset it if i m listening to youtube with head phones and disconnect bluetooth the sound only comes out of the speaker at the ear of the phone so quiet you can t even hear it so i have to reset the phone again to get sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don t buy this garbage ', 'fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow but effective none the less the time i spent researching this phone was extensive or so i thought and the most i have ever on any phone so far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the network but has no actual internet access like connecting to a router but the but the modem is down i use my hotspot a ton since i have no actual internet once this issue is fixed hopefully it does then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up

little low at gb but nothing that will cause issues the camera is sub par but quite usable in everyday moments performance is on par with a phones no glitches or any issues overall a really good phone

definitely recommend purchasing it the red i got is so beautiful i brought it to t mobile to get the nano sim card and the clerk was like wow that s a sweet color i don t think t mobile carries the

that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

battery life it last for the entire day and if you need a charge it s quick charging the screen isn t the greatest but it s decent the camera isn t the best but it s adequate the ring is loud okay to sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

getting rained on this phone was in store but buying it cheaper on amazon i ve had no problems whatsoever i transferred my sim myself and sd card optional and i m up and running no phone call or tech

minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of

out to be well worth the money now when i first got this phone it was kinda hard to sign into things as it took forever to long into accounts on my ebay amazon and facebook though after a couple days of having the phone it was a breeze to do so ', 'arrived on time wonderful phone i was able to connect it to my metro pcs account ', 'i am very picky about my phones but i refuse to pay high dollar

fixed this phone is amazing for the price the battery lasts all day under heavy use and always has at least left at the end of the day the build looks premium and feels premium too with a case on the stars are for the fingerprint reader it is terrible it worked fine for the first week or so but now only reads successfully maybe of the time other than that it is a great phone nice large amoled

headed that way too ', 'so far so good that was first day review but i found it is a very poor phone after four days it dropped onto the my wooden floor and no breakage and no scratch found in fact the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few amazing features that even now i love however many of the negative reviews touch on the service quality this phone has even with or bars of lte and on wifi calling this phone struggles to connect with the network my previous phone had no issues in the same spots all my calls are dropped fuzzy or fail to connect i absolutely hate this phone i can t believe i waited days for it since someone at amazon stole my original one on the positive the camera is amazing and the screen is very nice don t order this phone ', 'new update i ve had this new phone for two months i did not purchase the insurance since the end of last month the phone has been glitching alarm sound doesn t come on when alarm goes off but all sound is on i have to reset the phone every couple days to reset it if i m listening to youtube with head phones and disconnect bluetooth the sound only comes out of the speaker at the ear of the phone so quiet you can t even hear it so i have to reset the phone again to get sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don t buy this garbage ', 'fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow but effective none the less the time i spent researching this phone was extensive or so i thought and the most i have ever on any phone so far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the network but has no actual internet access like connecting to a router but the but the modem is down i use my hotspot a ton since i have no actual internet once this issue is fixed hopefully it does then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up

really nice device everything works well and battery life is awesome the only con i have is it doesn t use wifi calling and i live in a dead zone and my cell is my life line so i cant use the device as i would like so i m currently stuck with my bug phone still ', 'phone is fantastic but lte does not work on t mobile as advertised a phone can be great quality but it s not useful if my calls are cutting out and i can t load anything ', 'great battery life very bright screen although i am used to premium oled screens so this feels quite dull in colors but very close to the premium space is a little low at gb but nothing that will cause issues the camera is sub par but quite usable in everyday moments performance is on par with a phones no glitches or any issues overall a really good phone for the price ', 'was afraid at first but getting use to it the only thing is i cant put a second sim card in the entry thing wont pop back out', 'i am very glad i got this phone for the price and me not being a person that needs all the bells whistles and steven spielberg cameras i am very satisfied i got a deal with a free sd card too ', 'this phone is soooo awesome i love it and i would definitely recommend purchasing it the red i got is so beautiful i brought it to t mobile to get the nano sim card and the clerk was like wow that s a sweet color i don t think t mobile carries the red color so buy it from here overall the phone runs so smoothly battery is not trying to die at all and the processor is silkly smooth another great job by samsung ', 'after days i started having all types of technical issues people were telling me that my calls were going straight to voicemail i unplug the charger from the device and it would disconnect the phone from my conversation i press on the app and it would disconnect my phone conversation i returned device and got my refund i don t think all those issues was a coincidence you be the judge ', 'i am really happy with my purchase but there is the only thing that is very awful about this phone is getting signals for example i used to have motoe and i have had signals everywhere but after using this phone i can t talk in my home always i should stay in a specific place to talk anyway if you have a any problem with your carrier coverage please change your mind and get something else otherwise this phone is really good at performance and speed ', 'works very well ', 'esta bien por el precio que pagas por esta madre', 'this phone is international so it is a third party phone not from the us it s an excellent phone for

verizon straight talk would work excellent if you went through those tho i m sure im getting one right through straight talk so will be returning update i returned it and they were great with the refund anyways ', 'i have been using this phone for a little over a month and it offers everything a person could want in a cell phone great size for viewing e mails and outstanding camera and a solid value for its price point oh yes it does very well for calls and texts ', 'got the phone for my husband we have metropcs his old sim card didnt work so had to go to the authorize dealer and they had to put in a new sim card and they charged for the new sim card and activation fee so cost us about but worth it to get the phone to work it takes very clear pictures i love the look he really likes it

good oled screen slim and light as beautiful as iphone but price of latter ', 'this phone is so beautiful i used to have a samsung galaxy active and this looks so much more fancier than my old phone

much money on a phone ', 'i had this phone for over a month now and i wanted to let people know about this phone it has great features for a little price the best things about this phone is the battery life it last for the entire day and if you need a charge it s quick charging the screen isn t the greatest but it s decent the camera isn t the best but it s adequate the ring is loud okay to sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery and charging works great for tmobile not wireless charging nor water resistant expandable memory and slightly on the heavy side ', 'i needed a new phone after my galaxy j prime quit on me after getting rained on this phone was in store but buying it cheaper on amazon i ve had no problems whatsoever i transferred my sim myself and sd card optional and i m up and running no phone call or tech support bs it s a somewhat lower end phone in terms of parts performance but it isn t slow gb of memory and decent processor means it ll work optimally for the common user the fingerprint sensor on the back is literally my favorite feature ', 'overall the phone is definitely an impressive phone attention grabbing with the stunning infinity display with amazing resolution settings fingerprint sensor is very fast efficient allows most later versions of samsung apps however samsung pay is not compatible with this phone the only thing i have an issue with was when using the phone with metropcs the service didn t pick up good at my house so i was gonna have to use wi fi calling which i couldn t set up and get to properly function', 'excelente llego en buenas condiciones y a tiempo',

price really sketchy because at metro it was about more however i decided to buy it anyway because i called amazon to see if i could return it if something was wrong with it using amazon s warranty i could the phone arrived earlier than expected and i love it absolutely nothing wrong with it i was able to activate register it at metro for only dollars i don t regret my purchase at all high risk high reward ', 'bought this for my husband he couldn t stand the thought of spending much more than this on a phone he wasn t sure he would like it because of the size but after a few days he decided

the bezels are so thin i also like that since the phone is unlocked that i was easily able to switch out my sim card from my old phone and put it in this one and it worked immediately btw i have tracfone service plus samsung has so many neat features to their phones like samsung themes also the price is a definite selling point definitely pleased with the purchase ', 'this is pretty much a budget device that being said it is a delightful product for what it is this is the international version so it has exynos octacore chipset it has gb internal storage fast charge and a mah battery this model also came with a free gb sd card to expand your internal storage the amoled panel is amazing full hd performance is pretty fast for a budget device build quality is excellent all plastic

had them switch my lg stylo to this phone work perfectly the wifi works i can download my apps and it super fast when charging ', 'this is the nd phone i ve purchased in the same number of weeks i bought one for my wife and i loved the feel and looks of it the camera is great not exactly sure what a dual front camera does but the pictures are very clear it took a little work to adjust to the interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service number and they ll activate it for you and by calling you ll also save the activation fee we also kept the same sim card', 'the phone arrived on time a new phone to appreciate everything very well

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

battery life it last for the entire day and if you need a charge it s quick charging the screen isn t the greatest but it s decent the camera isn t the best but it s adequate the ring is loud okay to sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery and charging works great for tmobile not wireless charging nor water resistant expandable memory and slightly on the heavy side ', 'i needed a new phone after my galaxy j prime quit on me after getting rained on this phone was in store but buying it cheaper on amazon i ve had no problems whatsoever i transferred my sim myself and sd card optional and i m up and running no phone call or tech

tracfone service plus samsung has so many neat features to their phones like samsung themes also the price is a definite selling point definitely pleased with the purchase ', 'this is pretty much a

bought one for my wife and i loved the feel and looks of it the camera is great not exactly sure what a dual front camera does but the pictures are very clear it took a little work to adjust to the interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service number and they ll activate it for you and by calling you ll also save the activation fee we also kept the same sim card', 'the phone arrived on time a new phone to appreciate everything very well

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size which makes it easier to read and do other things the set up was fast and easy i just put my nano sim in and it started to set up i do have att prepaid and have had no problems with getting my g lte

think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

crisp ', 'okay first off i have metropcs and this phone works great with it i was a little skeptical at first when buying this phone as this was the first time getting an unlocked phone but it turned out to be well worth the money now when i first got this phone it was kinda hard to sign into things as it took forever to long into accounts on my ebay amazon and facebook though after a couple days of having the phone it was a breeze to do so ', 'arrived on time wonderful phone i was able to connect it to my metro pcs account ', 'i am very picky about my phones but i refuse to pay high dollar

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

insurance since the end of last month the phone has been glitching alarm sound doesn t come on when alarm goes off but all sound is on i have to reset the phone every couple days to reset it if i m listening to youtube with head phones and disconnect bluetooth the sound only comes out of the speaker at the ear of the phone so quiet you can t even hear it so i have to reset the phone again to get sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don t buy this garbage ', 'fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow but effective none the less the time i spent researching this phone was extensive or so i thought and the most i have ever on any phone so far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up

little low at gb but nothing that will cause issues the camera is sub par but quite usable in everyday moments performance is on par with a phones no glitches or any issues overall a really good phone

definitely recommend purchasing it the red i got is so beautiful i brought it to t mobile to get the nano sim card and the clerk was like wow that s a sweet color i don t think t mobile carries the

get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received

upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

little low at gb but nothing that will cause issues the camera is sub par but quite usable in everyday moments performance is on par with a phones no glitches or any issues overall a really good phone

definitely recommend purchasing it the red i got is so beautiful i brought it to t mobile to get the nano sim card and the clerk was like wow that s a sweet color i don t think t mobile carries the

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received

upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of

processor no the best k screen no cameras no but who cares why would i pay more to be able to take a better photo i would buy a dslr to do that if i need better pictures i would buy a tv if i would

crisp ', 'okay first off i have metropcs and this phone works great with it i was a little skeptical at first when buying this phone as this was the first time getting an unlocked phone but it turned out to be well worth the money now when i first got this phone it was kinda hard to sign into things as it took forever to long into accounts on my ebay amazon and facebook though after a couple days of having the phone it was a breeze to do so ', 'arrived on time wonderful phone i was able to connect it to my metro pcs account ', 'i am very picky about my phones but i refuse to pay high dollar

bright a camera works great the volume on the phone is good and setting it up to my personal preferences was very easy to do i am not disappointed at all and believe that this is probably one of the best unlocked cell phones that i bought at a great price by the way i am using straight talk sim card with at t service on it ', 'i have been using this phone for nearly a month while my s is being fixed this phone is amazing for the price the battery lasts all day under heavy use and always has at least left at the end of the day the build looks premium and feels premium too with a case on the

headed that way too ', 'so far so good that was first day review but i found it is a very poor phone after four days it dropped onto the my wooden floor and no breakage and no scratch found in fact the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few amazing features that even now i love however many of the negative reviews touch on the service quality this phone has even with or bars of lte and on wifi calling this phone struggles to connect with the network my previous phone had no issues in the same spots all my calls are dropped fuzzy or fail to connect i absolutely hate this phone i can t believe i waited days for it since someone at amazon stole my original one on the positive the camera is amazing and the screen is very nice don t order this phone ', 'new update i ve had this new phone for two months i did not purchase the insurance since the end of last month the phone has been glitching alarm sound doesn t come on when alarm goes off but all sound is on i have to reset the phone every couple days to reset it if i m listening to youtube with head phones and disconnect bluetooth the sound only comes out of the speaker at the ear of the phone so quiet you can t even hear it so i have to reset the phone again to get sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don t buy this garbage ', 'fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow but effective none the less the time i spent researching this phone was extensive or so i thought and the most i have ever on any phone so far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the network but has no actual internet access like connecting to a router but the but the modem is down i use my hotspot a ton since i have no actual internet once this issue is fixed hopefully it does then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up

cutting out and i can t load anything ', 'great battery life very bright screen although i am used to premium oled screens so this feels quite dull in colors but very close to the premium space is a little low at gb but nothing that will cause issues the camera is sub par but quite usable in everyday moments performance is on par with a phones no glitches or any issues overall a really good phone for the price ', 'was afraid at first but getting use to it the only thing is i cant put a second sim card in the entry thing wont pop back out', 'i am very glad i got this phone for the price and me

definitely recommend purchasing it the red i got is so beautiful i brought it to t mobile to get the nano sim card and the clerk was like wow that s a sweet color i don t think t mobile carries the

types of technical issues people were telling me that my calls were going straight to voicemail i unplug the charger from the device and it would disconnect the phone from my conversation i press on

there is the only thing that is very awful about this phone is getting signals for example i used to have motoe and i have had signals everywhere but after using this phone i can t talk in my home

battery life it last for the entire day and if you need a charge it s quick charging the screen isn t the greatest but it s decent the camera isn t the best but it s adequate the ring is loud okay to sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

getting rained on this phone was in store but buying it cheaper on amazon i ve had no problems whatsoever i transferred my sim myself and sd card optional and i m up and running no phone call or tech

bought one for my wife and i loved the feel and looks of it the camera is great not exactly sure what a dual front camera does but the pictures are very clear it took a little work to adjust to the interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not

finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at

bought one for my wife and i loved the feel and looks of it the camera is great not exactly sure what a dual front camera does but the pictures are very clear it took a little work to adjust to the interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size which makes it easier to read and do other things the set up was fast and easy i just put my nano sim in and it started to set up i do have att prepaid and have had no problems with getting my g lte

think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size which makes it easier to read and do other things the set up was fast and easy i just put my nano sim in and it started to set up i do have att prepaid and have had no problems with getting my g lte

think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

crisp ', 'okay first off i have metropcs and this phone works great with it i was a little skeptical at first when buying this phone as this was the first time getting an unlocked phone but it turned out to be well worth the money now when i first got this phone it was kinda hard to sign into things as it took forever to long into accounts on my ebay amazon and facebook though after a couple days of having the phone it was a breeze to do so ', 'arrived on time wonderful phone i was able to connect it to my metro pcs account ', 'i am very picky about my phones but i refuse to pay high dollar

bright a camera works great the volume on the phone is good and setting it up to my personal preferences was very easy to do i am not disappointed at all and believe that this is probably one of the best unlocked cell phones that i bought at a great price by the way i am using straight talk sim card with at t service on it ', 'i have been using this phone for nearly a month while my s is being fixed this phone is amazing for the price the battery lasts all day under heavy use and always has at least left at the end of the day the build looks premium and feels premium too with a case on the

headed that way too ', 'so far so good that was first day review but i found it is a very poor phone after four days it dropped onto the my wooden floor and no breakage and no scratch found in fact the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

insurance since the end of last month the phone has been glitching alarm sound doesn t come on when alarm goes off but all sound is on i have to reset the phone every couple days to reset it if i m listening to youtube with head phones and disconnect bluetooth the sound only comes out of the speaker at the ear of the phone so quiet you can t even hear it so i have to reset the phone again to get sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size which makes it easier to read and do other things the set up was fast and easy i just put my nano sim in and it started to set up i do have att prepaid and have had no problems with getting my g lte

think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

processor no the best k screen no cameras no but who cares why would i pay more to be able to take a better photo i would buy a dslr to do that if i need better pictures i would buy a tv if i would

crisp ', 'okay first off i have metropcs and this phone works great with it i was a little skeptical at first when buying this phone as this was the first time getting an unlocked phone but it turned out to be well worth the money now when i first got this phone it was kinda hard to sign into things as it took forever to long into accounts on my ebay amazon and facebook though after a couple days of having the phone it was a breeze to do so ', 'arrived on time wonderful phone i was able to connect it to my metro pcs account ', 'i am very picky about my phones but i refuse to pay high dollar for one this phone is exceptional for what the pricee is all i did was plug in my sim card and my sd card turned it on and boom immediately impressed it does everything i need the screen is great and bright a camera works great the volume on the phone is good and setting it up to my personal preferences was very easy to do i am not disappointed at all and believe that this is probably one of the best unlocked cell phones that i bought at a great price by the way i am using straight talk sim card with at t service on it ', 'i have been using this phone for nearly a month while my s is being fixed this phone is amazing for the price the battery lasts all day under heavy use and always has at least left at the end of the day the build looks premium and feels premium too with a case on the

headed that way too ', 'so far so good that was first day review but i found it is a very poor phone after four days it dropped onto the my wooden floor and no breakage and no scratch found in fact the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few amazing features that even now i love however many of the negative reviews touch on the service quality this phone has even with or bars of lte and on wifi calling this phone struggles to connect with the network my previous phone had no issues in the same spots all my calls are dropped fuzzy or fail to connect i absolutely hate this phone i can t believe i waited days for it since someone at

insurance since the end of last month the phone has been glitching alarm sound doesn t come on when alarm goes off but all sound is on i have to reset the phone every couple days to reset it if i m listening to youtube with head phones and disconnect bluetooth the sound only comes out of the speaker at the ear of the phone so quiet you can t even hear it so i have to reset the phone again to get sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don t buy this garbage ', 'fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow but effective none the less the time i spent researching this phone was extensive or so i thought and the most i have ever on any phone so far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the network but has no actual internet access like connecting to a router but the but the modem is down i use my hotspot a ton since i have no actual internet once this issue is fixed hopefully it does then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up

cutting out and i can t load anything ', 'great battery life very bright screen although i am used to premium oled screens so this feels quite dull in colors but very close to the premium space is a little low at gb but nothing that will cause issues the camera is sub par but quite usable in everyday moments performance is on par with a phones no glitches or any issues overall a really good phone for the price ', 'was afraid at first but getting use to it the only thing is i cant put a second sim card in the entry thing wont pop back out', 'i am very glad i got this phone for the price and me

definitely recommend purchasing it the red i got is so beautiful i brought it to t mobile to get the nano sim card and the clerk was like wow that s a sweet color i don t think t mobile carries the

types of technical issues people were telling me that my calls were going straight to voicemail i unplug the charger from the device and it would disconnect the phone from my conversation i press on

there is the only thing that is very awful about this phone is getting signals for example i used to have motoe and i have had signals everywhere but after using this phone i can t talk in my home

refund anyways ', 'i have been using this phone for a little over a month and it offers everything a person could want in a cell phone great size for viewing e mails and outstanding camera and a solid value for its price point oh yes it does very well for calls and texts ', 'got the phone for my husband we have metropcs his old sim card didnt work so had to go to the authorize dealer and they had to put in a new sim card and they charged for the new sim card and activation fee so cost us about but worth it to get the phone to work it takes very clear pictures i love the look he really likes it

battery life it last for the entire day and if you need a charge it s quick charging the screen isn t the greatest but it s decent the camera isn t the best but it s adequate the ring is loud okay to sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

bought one for my wife and i loved the feel and looks of it the camera is great not exactly sure what a dual front camera does but the pictures are very clear it took a little work to adjust to the interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service number and they ll activate it for you and by calling you ll also save the activation fee we also kept the same sim card', 'the phone arrived on time a new phone to appreciate everything very well

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size which makes it easier to read and do other things the set up was fast and easy i just put my nano sim in and it started to set up i do have att prepaid and have had no problems with getting my g lte normally i don t care about the camera but this phone has a great camera very clear pictures i m still pretty much learning still with this phone but i do recommend checking it out for the price i think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t load and bluetooth doesn t work without the phone being connected to wi fi i ve called at t and they don t know how to fix the issue i m waiting for a response from samsung ', 'this phone feels looks and performs like it should be in the to range the screen has great colors and the feel of the entire phone is great very nice to hold it feels high quality like a flagship phone should fingerprint

over the iphone x or note ', 'great deal on a brand new never opened galaxy a although it is the international version the charger still fits u s outlets and no adapter is needed super functional and

processor no the best k screen no cameras no but who cares why would i pay more to be able to take a better photo i would buy a dslr to do that if i need better pictures i would buy a tv if i would

crisp ', 'okay first off i have metropcs and this phone works great with it i was a little skeptical at first when buying this phone as this was the first time getting an unlocked phone but it turned out to be well worth the money now when i first got this phone it was kinda hard to sign into things as it took forever to long into accounts on my ebay amazon and facebook though after a couple days of having the phone it was a breeze to do so ', 'arrived on time wonderful phone i was able to connect it to my metro pcs account ', 'i am very picky about my phones but i refuse to pay high dollar for one this phone is exceptional for what the pricee is all i did was plug in my sim card and my sd card turned it on and boom immediately impressed it does everything i need the screen is great and bright a camera works great the volume on the phone is good and setting it up to my personal preferences was very easy to do i am not disappointed at all and believe that this is probably one of the best unlocked cell phones that i bought at a great price by the way i am using straight talk sim card with at t service on it ', 'i have been using this phone for nearly a month while my s is being fixed this phone is amazing for the price the battery lasts all day under heavy use and always has at least left at the end of the day the build looks premium and feels premium too with a case on the stars are for the fingerprint reader it is terrible it worked fine for the first week or so but now only reads successfully maybe of the time other than that it is a great phone nice large amoled

reception when previous motorola phone almost always had full coverage same carrier i was really looking forward getting back to samsung as motorola quality is sub par but now it appears samsung is headed that way too ', 'so far so good that was first day review but i found it is a very poor phone after four days it dropped onto the my wooden floor and no breakage and no scratch found in fact the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few amazing features that even now i love however many of the negative reviews touch on the service quality this phone has even with or bars of lte and on wifi calling this phone struggles to connect with the network my previous phone had no issues in the same spots all my calls are dropped fuzzy or fail to connect i absolutely hate this phone i can t believe i waited days for it since someone at amazon stole my original one on the positive the camera is amazing and the screen is very nice don t order this phone ', 'new update i ve had this new phone for two months i did not purchase the insurance since the end of last month the phone has been glitching alarm sound doesn t come on when alarm goes off but all sound is on i have to reset the phone every couple days to reset it if i m listening to youtube with head phones and disconnect bluetooth the sound only comes out of the speaker at the ear of the phone so quiet you can t even hear it so i have to reset the phone again to get sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don t buy this garbage ', 'fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow but effective none the less the time i spent researching this phone was extensive or so i thought and the most i have ever on any phone so far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the network but has no actual internet access like connecting to a router but the but the modem is down i use my hotspot a ton since i have no actual internet once this issue is fixed hopefully it does then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up and transfer of data from old phone in about minutes i didnt transfer all apps and wish i would have bit of learning curve but easy ', 'i would have loved to give the phone stars but i rated it s a really nice device everything works well and battery life is awesome the only con i have is it doesn t use wifi calling and i live in a dead zone and my cell is my life line so i cant use the device as i would like so i m currently stuck with my bug phone still ', 'phone is fantastic but lte does not work on t mobile as advertised a phone can be great quality but it s not useful if my calls are cutting out and i can t load anything ', 'great battery life very bright screen although i am used to premium oled screens so this feels quite dull in colors but very close to the premium space is a little low at gb but nothing that will cause issues the camera is sub par but quite usable in everyday moments performance is on par with a phones no glitches or any issues overall a really good phone for the price ', 'was afraid at first but getting use to it the only thing is i cant put a second sim card in the entry thing wont pop back out', 'i am very glad i got this phone for the price and me not being a person that needs all the bells whistles and steven spielberg cameras i am very satisfied i got a deal with a free sd card too ', 'this phone is soooo awesome i love it and i would definitely recommend purchasing it the red i got is so beautiful i brought it to t mobile to get the nano sim card and the clerk was like wow that s a sweet color i don t think t mobile carries the red color so buy it from here overall the phone runs so smoothly battery is not trying to die at all and the processor is silkly smooth another great job by samsung ', 'after days i started having all types of technical issues people were telling me that my calls were going straight to voicemail i unplug the charger from the device and it would disconnect the phone from my conversation i press on the app and it would disconnect my phone conversation i returned device and got my refund i don t think all those issues was a coincidence you be the judge ', 'i am really happy with my purchase but there is the only thing that is very awful about this phone is getting signals for example i used to have motoe and i have had signals everywhere but after using this phone i can t talk in my home

performance and speed ', 'works very well ', 'esta bien por el precio que pagas por esta madre', 'this phone is international so it is a third party phone not from the us it s an excellent phone for the price but deff spend a few extra bucks and try and find a better place to get it i go through straight talk which is said it d work on doesn t it only works for at t and t mobile straight talk not verizon straight talk would work excellent if you went through those tho i m sure im getting one right through straight talk so will be returning update i returned it and they were great with the refund anyways ', 'i have been using this phone for a little over a month and it offers everything a person could want in a cell phone great size for viewing e mails and outstanding camera and a solid value for its price point oh yes it does very well for calls and texts ', 'got the phone for my husband we have metropcs his old sim card didnt work so had to go to the authorize dealer and they had to put in a new sim card and they charged for the new sim card and activation fee so cost us about but worth it to get the phone to work it takes very clear pictures i love the look he really likes it

battery life it last for the entire day and if you need a charge it s quick charging the screen isn t the greatest but it s decent the camera isn t the best but it s adequate the ring is loud okay to sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery and charging works great for tmobile not wireless charging nor water resistant expandable memory and slightly on the heavy side ', 'i needed a new phone after my galaxy j prime quit on me after getting rained on this phone was in store but buying it cheaper on amazon i ve had no problems whatsoever i transferred my sim myself and sd card optional and i m up and running no phone call or tech support bs it s a somewhat lower end phone in terms of parts performance but it isn t slow gb of memory and decent processor means it ll work optimally for the common user the fingerprint sensor on

defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of

fixed this phone is amazing for the price the battery lasts all day under heavy use and always has at least left at the end of the day the build looks premium and feels premium too with a case on the

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up

little low at gb but nothing that will cause issues the camera is sub par but quite usable in everyday moments performance is on par with a phones no glitches or any issues overall a really good phone

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this

after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome

version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the

old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don

far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps

defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps

defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know

what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this

research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few amazing features that even now i love however many of the negative reviews touch on the service quality this phone has even with or bars of lte and on wifi calling this phone struggles to connect with the network my previous phone had no issues in the same spots all my calls are dropped fuzzy or fail to connect i absolutely hate this phone i can t believe i waited days for it since someone at

insurance since the end of last month the phone has been glitching alarm sound doesn t come on when alarm goes off but all sound is on i have to reset the phone every couple days to reset it if i m listening to youtube with head phones and disconnect bluetooth the sound only comes out of the speaker at the ear of the phone so quiet you can t even hear it so i have to reset the phone again to get sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don t buy this garbage ', 'fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow but effective none the less the time i spent researching this phone was extensive or so i thought and the most i have ever on any phone so far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

then i will bump up my rating ', 'new phone cost of old android arrived within days of order well packaged including sim card tool will fit all sim card sizes clear and easy instructions for set up

types of technical issues people were telling me that my calls were going straight to voicemail i unplug the charger from the device and it would disconnect the phone from my conversation i press on

there is the only thing that is very awful about this phone is getting signals for example i used to have motoe and i have had signals everywhere but after using this phone i can t talk in my home

battery life it last for the entire day and if you need a charge it s quick charging the screen isn t the greatest but it s decent the camera isn t the best but it s adequate the ring is loud okay to sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery and charging works great for tmobile not wireless charging nor water resistant expandable memory and slightly on the heavy side ', 'i needed a new phone after my galaxy j prime quit on me after getting rained on this phone was in store but buying it cheaper on amazon i ve had no problems whatsoever i transferred my sim myself and sd card optional and i m up and running no phone call or tech

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

types of technical issues people were telling me that my calls were going straight to voicemail i unplug the charger from the device and it would disconnect the phone from my conversation i press on

there is the only thing that is very awful about this phone is getting signals for example i used to have motoe and i have had signals everywhere but after using this phone i can t talk in my home

battery life it last for the entire day and if you need a charge it s quick charging the screen isn t the greatest but it s decent the camera isn t the best but it s adequate the ring is loud okay to sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery and charging works great for tmobile not wireless charging nor water resistant expandable memory and slightly on the heavy side ', 'i needed a new phone after my galaxy j prime quit on me after getting rained on this phone was in store but buying it cheaper on amazon i ve had no problems whatsoever i transferred my sim myself and sd card optional and i m up and running no phone call or tech support bs it s a somewhat lower end phone in terms of parts performance but it isn t slow gb of memory and decent processor means it ll work optimally for the common user the fingerprint sensor on

got it because i needed a new phone asap and i have not regretted my choice it has a dual camera it s not amazing quality but its great for the price the fingerprint sensor doesn t always pick it up

bought one for my wife and i loved the feel and looks of it the camera is great not exactly sure what a dual front camera does but the pictures are very clear it took a little work to adjust to the interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service number and they ll activate it for you and by calling you ll also save the activation fee we also kept the same sim card', 'the phone arrived on time a new phone to appreciate everything very well without a scratch or anything but the battery arrived defective the battery was discharged very quickly and easily the battery goes from percent to percent in just a few minutes i easily downloaded

the dual sim is a nice touch compatible with at t the camera is good and it s just a good looking phone i d recommend this over the s that i have because it s a fraction of the cost and basically just as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size which makes it easier to read and do other things the set up was fast and easy i just put my nano sim in and it started to set up i do have att prepaid and have had no problems with getting my g lte

think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t load and bluetooth doesn t work without the phone being connected to wi fi i ve called at t and they don t know how to fix the issue i m waiting for a response from samsung ', 'this phone feels looks and performs like it should be in the to range the screen has great colors and the feel of the entire phone is great very nice to hold it feels high quality like a flagship phone should fingerprint

over the iphone x or note ', 'great deal on a brand new never opened galaxy a although it is the international version the charger still fits u s outlets and no adapter is needed super functional and

processor no the best k screen no cameras no but who cares why would i pay more to be able to take a better photo i would buy a dslr to do that if i need better pictures i would buy a tv if i would

crisp ', 'okay first off i have metropcs and this phone works great with it i was a little skeptical at first when buying this phone as this was the first time getting an unlocked phone but it turned out to be well worth the money now when i first got this phone it was kinda hard to sign into things as it took forever to long into accounts on my ebay amazon and facebook though after a couple days of having the phone it was a breeze to do so ', 'arrived on time wonderful phone i was able to connect it to my metro pcs account ', 'i am very picky about my phones but i refuse to pay high dollar for one this phone is exceptional for what the pricee is all i did was plug in my sim card and my sd card turned it on and boom immediately impressed it does everything i need the screen is great and bright a camera works great the volume on the phone is good and setting it up to my personal preferences was very easy to do i am not disappointed at all and believe that this is probably one of the

fixed this phone is amazing for the price the battery lasts all day under heavy use and always has at least left at the end of the day the build looks premium and feels premium too with a case on the

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is

believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

interface the apps are hidden and have to be brought out but once i found out how to add them to the main pages it works good the only issue i have is the fingerprint reader is not as good but i believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as i have the same problem with other readers that i have used i like the dual sim as my wife and i travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay and go sim and use it without removing our us sim i am at t and the network and data appears to be great ', 'the wi fi don t work', 'i wanted to like the a i really did but the a just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

think you will be surprised ', 'we bought this phone for the wifey she had an apple i phone c for years but as we are switching to tmobile this is no use as it won t work with that carrier we weren t looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you

with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

sum it up it s not the best phone but it s a great phone for this price everything is not the best but it is decent if you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time great battery

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

for one this phone is exceptional for what the pricee is all i did was plug in my sim card and my sd card turned it on and boom immediately impressed it does everything i need the screen is great and bright a camera works great the volume on the phone is good and setting it up to my personal preferences was very easy to do i am not disappointed at all and believe that this is probably one of the

fixed this phone is amazing for the price the battery lasts all day under heavy use and always has at least left at the end of the day the build looks premium and feels premium too with a case on the

the phone was protected by flip cover but display damaged how come my other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor never been damaged i suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

looking for anything expensive or flashy really just needed a decent phone at a decent price this was that phone but it was a bit better than expected the screen huge especially compared the the old i phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

that prompt after dropping from my hand because the phone was not securely shipped the phone box was open as well i suspect it s a duplicate phone not original i contacted support they said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my s this was replacement for that phone and i was under the impression it was plastic on the back which is what i preferred also it s kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker ', 'when i put in the microsd card that it came with the slot couldn t get pushed all the way so i have to replace it with my old one a gray sandisk card and the slot close prefectly ', ' no nfc are you kidding me how cheap of samsung this is a phone now i know why the phone was under it doesn t support google pay samsung pay or anything and i noticed the wi fi signal is really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this phone bought it for my yr old brother and i m thinking of buying one for myself lol someone here said it doesn t work with metro pcs it does work with metro pcs you need to call the customer service

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is

sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows

extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the

to have issues that was a no go for me so i returned it also i need to take some blame in buying this phone because i did not do my due diligence on researching the a before purchasing it i received the a this past sunday july th i opened the package got the a set up and was ready to use it i was excited in less than minutes after getting the a set up i started to have issues with it first of all upon booting up the a for the first time the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language now that s not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think that s kinda of unusual the phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet now i know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it being a mid range phone but i at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience also the ui interface of the a lags as well sometimes the a also kept self closing out when i was using the internet for about minutes when i kept trying to use the internet after about seconds into reading a website the a would just crash and close out from the internet i was so frustrated this last part is on me because i didn t due my diligence before purchasing this phone now i knew this phone didn t have a notification led light but i still was going to purchase it because i figured it would have the always on display for notifications nope wrong the a doesn t have always on display either which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls texts or notifications now i know whoever reads this review might say so what you have to check the phone manually what s wrong with that i m making a big deal out of nothing well for me once you use a phone that has notifications led and always on display it s hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications now this phone is nice it has a inch super amoled almost bezel less screen which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only tops if you want this phone than buy but i would just beware of this phone it would be better to look for other mid range phones with better specs ', 'this phone has a weird glitch when i go to reply to a text sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up just a simple tap in the text box doesn t always bring up the keyboard other than that it seems to be fine i didn t realize it s glass completely on all sides or i would not have purchased it i had had enough of the glass cracking issue with

really bad you walk into another room and try to watch a video it s gonna get glitchy i cannot believe i fell for this if your buying this phone for your grandma it ll work fine but if you were born after and you wanna use a st century phone i don t recommend this one decent wi fi is one of the most fundamental necessities of a smart phone this one doesn t even have that the range is just terrible another thing if you have used a nexus or pixel before you re gonna hate all the crap samsung gives you they want you to use samsung pay instead of google pay samsung web instead of chrome samsung galary instead of google photos etc the most pathetic one is galaxy store i hate samsung for this matter if they would just use plane and simple android it would have been so much easier for everyone samsung should never be shoving their softwares up people s butts it s stupid of them samsung was never a software company and never will be i wanna see samsung try and replace google maps with samsung maps that would be most ridiculous of them all nfc is more important to me than camera quality and screen quality it s not something you can live without in this era ', 'phone was defective ', 'it s easy to be picky about the device you are using but when you remember how much you paid for it it also becomes easier to forgive the things you are being picky about we all know what the flagship phones are capable of this is what this particular phone is missing from those flagships a super nice camera these cameras are fine but clearly you won t be shooting quality like what the google pixel phones are capable of haptic feedback i m not sure why it s not there but it isn t you can get around this by installing an app called setedit and changing the haptic feedback enabled from to change at your own risk the latest fastest chipset obviously you re not going to get that with a phone that costs th the cost of most flagships it has a fingerprint reader but it doesn t always work that well this was my experience perhaps you will have no issues with this other than the things listed above i have literally no complaint i don t use my phone for much mainly google maps and texting calling that s about it i thought maybe the phone would be a bit sluggish which you can definitely notice some sluggish ness when doing a lot at once but it s not to the point of being annoying keep in mind what you re getting here the you get what you pay for is super accurate when it comes to tech thankfully the budget phones for android have been stepping up their game however it is still th the cost of a lot of flagship devices which are insanely spec ed out so don t get this expecting the experience of a google pixel galaxy note iphone ', 'i absolutely love this

as good', 'i have always wanted to step up to owning a galaxy phone but it was always out of my price range until i saw the galaxy a with a large inch screen at a more affordable price after doing research on the specs i made the decision to buy it online from amazon prime i chose the u s version unlocked that came with a month warranty only available in black color instead of the international version with no warranty i took the phone to my wireless carrier and they were great in helping to transfer all my stuff over from my old phone i noticed how fast the downloading was on the a the phone is very light it looks so blah in the black color so i am ordering a cover for it in a bright color from amazon prime the length of the phone is great but the width across looks narrower than my old phone the audio from the speaker is good but when i use it with my headphones to listen to a music video the sound doesn t sound full enough like it did on my old phone it could be that my headphones might not be compatible with the a so i went to the google playstore on my phone and found a volume booster to enhance the sound and it is much better now the clarity of the picture doesn t seem to look any better than the clarity that i had on my old phone so i was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews about the clarity i guess i was expecting something better on it in conclusion i am still happy with the phone because of now having reached the status of owing a samsung phone ', 'i m really loving this phone for the price of this phone it s wonderful the screen is full size

phones but more it is really clear and the colors are great people who get into all the specs and are more technically minded will perhaps tell you there are better screens and why but were not creating art on it so it works for a normal person the memory and processing speed look good so far the onboard memory is big enough she won t need to worry about it for a long time and the apps she is using seem to work well on it the phone itself is attractive to look at she loves the color and the shape of the screen and the finger print reader works well for her though if you have a damp finger it has a bit of trouble registering she hasn t tried the facial recognition yet but if there are any issues with it i will update this the camera is pretty good too that s not terribly important for her it s just a million cat pictures with them doing something daft where we have used other phones with better cameras we really can t complain it s perfect for us will come back to update our review if it turns out there are flaws we haven t uncovered yet but if you don t need all the top of the line stuff and don t want to spend a lot this is a great option it has a lot of attractive frilly bits at a much lower cost ', 'awesome phone just wish it was compatible with my at t prepaid service i get calls texts and some use of internet pictures on social media apps won t

dropped it happened so they cannot do anything the worst phone ever never buy seller also not recommended i uploaded few photos st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man as you can see no protection nd after dropping from my hand rd display situation after dropping be careful don t buy anything from this seller ', 'coming from a flagship iphone plus and always having been with iphone since the iphone g this phone is actually decent for the price and is even cheaper given the fact that it s an international phone would i have considered going with a global version of this phone probably not as i d much rather go for a cheaper used flagship phone or save my money toward a newer flagship phone now i ve been using this phone for about weeks and i like it for most basic uses such as calling texting web search and and watching videos i d say the call quality is subpar especially when you have the phone against your ear but the regular speaker is alright good enough to listen to most sound which is why i mostly use the regular speaker to do listen to calls one thing that this phone has going for it is that it has an amoled screen i would say that using android for a change isn t that much different than using ios the apps are there the operating system is smooth and now i m thinking of sticking with android for one reason the asus rog phone runs android and is a flagship phone that i d like to own plus using one single os for a long time gets a little stale i still own an ipad pro apple tv and mac mini and they have their purposes but with a gaming phone in mind i believe i ll be sticking with android update in this update i m mostly gonna talk about the mah battery and fast charge the battery i have to say is impressive as i ve gone at least hours without having to charge the phone with normal usage video playback included now as far as fast charging is concerned it charges from to in less than about an hour and a half this phone is definitely a good phone for its budget price ', 'excelente relaci n calidad precio para la exigencia del d a a d a se porta bien el tel fono', 'i loved this phone when i first got it it has a few amazing features that even now i love however many of the negative reviews touch on the service quality this phone has even with or bars of lte and on wifi calling this phone struggles to connect with

insurance since the end of last month the phone has been glitching alarm sound doesn t come on when alarm goes off but all sound is on i have to reset the phone every couple days to reset it if i m listening to youtube with head phones and disconnect bluetooth the sound only comes out of the speaker at the ear of the phone so quiet you can t even hear it so i have to reset the phone again to get sound this has happened over ten times in the past month i never know when my alarm will not work and now when i try to contact support it asked me to enter my phone number yet i can t it shows another number for the phone and will not let me enter my number the number it shows for call back was never mine this is supposed to be a new phone piece of crap and now it s to late to return it don t buy this garbage ', 'fingerprint reader is a tad bit slow but effective none the less the time i spent researching this phone was extensive or so i thought and the most i have ever on any phone so far no nfc on this version international which i do not mind at all currently on the cricket network and g lte works excellent battery lasts me all day and still get home with about juice left the extra sim slot gives me hope and drive to one day use it over seas some day screen is beautiful and clear only reason for the three stars is because the mobile hotspot has issues connects to the
